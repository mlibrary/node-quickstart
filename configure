You need to install node first. If you're on a mac, you can run:

    brew install node

If you're on linux, you should use the package manager of your choice to
install node and npm.

If you're on windows, please get in touch with me so that I can help you
set this up. Ideally, I'll learn enough to be able to add windows
support to this quickstart repository.

Once node is installed, just run this script again:

    ./configure
